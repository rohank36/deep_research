The user's query involves historical research about specific educational institutions, which often requires looking into archives, historical records, or reliable educational databases. The request to find the name of a girls' school that was merged with a boys' school in the '90s to form a new coeducational school (with a Latin name) involves several aspects:

1. Identifying the new coeducational school formed in the '90s, including its Latin name, which will directly link to the schools involved in its founding.
2. Researching the town's educational history to find secondary sources that mention the merger.
3. Identifying the names of both the girls' and boys' schools.

Given the nature of the query, it's best approached as a straightforward query since it is highly specific and well-defined. This query is similar to fact-finding involving specific historical events and entities.

To address this, I will deploy a subagent to investigate reputable sources, such as historical records or educational archives, to find this specific piece of information.

The query can be effectively answered by a single focused investigation or fetching a single resource from the internet. I will instruct the subagent to search for information about school mergers in the '90s involving a girls' and a boys' school that resulted in the creation of a coeducational school with a Latin name, in a town with a history dating back to the second half of the 19th century.
