The user's query requires historical research on a specific school merger that occurred in the 1990s, leading to the formation of a coeducational institution with a Latin name. The key task is to identify the name of the original girls' school that was part of this merger.

To address this query, information needs to be gathered about:
1. Schools that combined in the 1990s.
2. The specific town with historical roots as early as the late 19th century.
3. Identification of a new coeducational school with a Latin name from this merger.

The users’ query is narrow and there might be limited relevant resources—local historical records, news archives, or educational institution archives from the '90s.

This is a depth-first query, as it focuses primarily on piecing together historical details about one core event—the merger of two schools. Diverse perspectives from regional historical documents, education records, and news articles of the time could uncover the necessary details.

To approach this, I will:
1. Investigate records or articles discussing mergers of schools in the '90s.
2. Identify the two original institutions involved, focusing on those in a town with late-19th-century history.
3. Establish the Latin-named school that emerged from this merger to confirm the girls’ school's name.
4. Review sources that may offer these details, such as local histories or educational records.

I will deploy a subagent to research any notable school mergers from the '90s that match these criteria and retrieve the specifics of the girls' school involved.
