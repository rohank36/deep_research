The key task is to identify the name of the original girls' school that was part of this merger.\n\nTo address this query, information needs to be gathered about:\n1. Schools that combined in the 1990s.\n2. The specific town with historical roots as early as the late 19th century.\n3. Identification of a new coeducational school with a Latin name from this merger.\n\nThe users\u2019 query is narrow and there might be limited relevant resources\u2014local historical records, news archives, or educational institution archives from the '90s.\n\nThis is a depth-first query, as it focuses primarily on piecing together historical details about one core event\u2014the merger of two schools. Diverse perspectives from regional historical documents, education records, and news articles of the time could uncover the necessary details.\n\nTo approach this, I will:\n1. Investigate records or articles discussing mergers of schools in the '90s.\n2. Identify the two original institutions involved, focusing on those in a town with late-19th-century history.\n3. Establish the Latin-named school that emerged from this merger to confirm the girls\u2019 school's name.\n4. Review sources that may offer these details, such as local histories or educational records.\n\nI will deploy a subagent to research any notable school mergers from the '90s that match these criteria and retrieve the specifics of the girls' school involved.", "signature": "6b17d169ddc3466b9506958bafc189f0", "datetime": "2025-07-02 00:14:41.615484"}, "memory_uid": "e66d4af8885a4d298f97bc978fb8bf9e"}, {"agent_uid": "57b8a3425ff54b84bea90d0714734077", "content": {"name": "run_blocking_subagent", "input": {"prompt": "Investigate notable school mergers from the 1990s that resulted in coeducational institutions, especially in towns with late-19th-century history.
