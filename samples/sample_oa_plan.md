The query is about a specific new school founded in the 1990s by merging a girls' school and a boys' school in a town with a history dating back to the late 19th century. The new school was given a Latin name, and the question is what was the original name of the girls' school before the merger.

To answer this, I need to:
1. Identify notable cases where girls' and boys' schools merged in the 1990s to form a coeducational school with a Latin name.
2. Focus on towns with a history going back to the second half of the 19th century.
3. Find the name of the girls' school involved in such a merger.

Since this is a historical and somewhat specific educational question, I should first try to identify which new school with a Latin name was formed in the 1990s from a merger of gender-segregated schools. Then, figure out the girls' school name.

This appears to be a breadth-first-search type problem: I need to consider different plausible schools or places that match these criteria, then find the one that fits.

I will run multiple subagents in parallel to look for mergers of girls' and boys' schools in the 1990s with Latin names, also focusing on the historical town clue.

I will run three searches in parallel:
1. Search for notable coeducational schools founded in the 1990s from merging boys' and girls' schools that have a Latin name.
2. Search for girls' schools in towns with 19th-century history that merged with boys' schools in the 1990s.
3. Search for towns with Latin-named schools founded in the 1990s by merging gender-segregated schools.

This will help triangulate the correct girls' school name.

I am researching notable coeducational schools founded in the 1990s by merging girls' and boys' schools where the new school was given a Latin name. I will also consider the historical context of the town dating back to the second half of the 19th century to find the name of the original girlsâ€™ school.
