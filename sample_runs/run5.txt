LLM RESULT (AgentType.ORCHESTRATOR):
<thinking>
The query asks for the most notable reinforcement learning professor at McGill University and the University of Toronto, respectively. This involves identifying key faculty members known specifically for their work in reinforcement learning from these two universities. Since this requires distinct and independent sub-questions about each university's notable RL professor, a breadth-first-search approach is appropriate. I will run two parallel subagents: one to find the most notable reinforcement learning professor at McGill University, and another to find the most notable reinforcement learning professor at the University of Toronto.

LLM RESULT (AgentType.WORKER):
<thinking>
To identify the most notable professor specializing in reinforcement learning at McGill University, I will start by searching for reinforcement learning experts or faculty members at McGill University. Usually, faculty pages, lab websites, or relevant academic profiles will list notable professors and their research focus areas. I will first perform a web search for "reinforcement learning professor McGill University" to locate relevant webpages such as department or lab pages. Then, I will fetch the content of the key URLs to confirm the professor's name and details.

LLM RESULT (AgentType.WORKER):
<thinking>
The search results show several individuals affiliated with University of Toronto who are involved in reinforcement learning or related fields such as deep reinforcement learning. Key people mentioned are:

- Chiguhn Lee (cglee.mie.utoronto.ca and research profile) who specializes in Markov decision processes, multiple agents, reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement learning with applications in finance, supply chain management, and revenue management.
- Jimmy Ba (jimmylba.github.io), who has an interest in reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and AI and completed a PhD under Geoffrey Hinton.
- Brokoslaw Laschowski (tcairem.utoronto.ca) with interests including reinforcement learning, AI, neural networks, deep learning, and computational neuroscience.

I will next fetch the faculty directory page from the University of Toronto's Department of Computer Science to check for reinforcement learning faculty listing and verify any highly notable professors. Also, I will gather more detailed information on Jimmy Ba, Chiguhn Lee, and Brokoslaw Laschowski from their respective pages to determine who is considered most notable regarding reinforcement learning. Jimmy Ba's connection to Geoffrey Hinton is notable in AI.

First, I will fetch the University of Toronto Computer Science faculty directory page to get a broader view of reinforcement learning experts there.

LLM RESULT (AgentType.WORKER):
<thinking>
From the University of Toronto's Department of Computer Science faculty directory content, I noted that Jimmy Ba is listed as an Associate Professor specializing in machine learning with research interests including deep learning, neural networks, and deep reinforcement learning. Sheila McIlraith, a Professor, also includes reinforcement learning among her research interests, particularly in AI planning and reinforcement learning.

Additionally, Richard Zemel is a Professor whose research areas include machine learning, though reinforcement learning is not explicitly mentioned in his summary. Other notable professors associated with reinforcement learning or close fields include Ravin Balakrishnan and Sanja Fidler, but Jimmy Ba's focus explicitly includes deep reinforcement learning and he completed his PhD under Geoffrey Hinton, a highly notable AI figure.

Among the results found initially for reinforcement learning at U of T, Chiguhn Lee works on reinforcement learning but appears from Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, not directly from Computer Science, and Brokoslaw Laschowski, focused more on computational neuroscience, AI, and brain-machine interfaces.

Thus, considering prominence, specific mention of reinforcement learning focus, and departmental affiliation, Jimmy Ba stands out as the most notable professor specializing in reinforcement learning at University of Toronto's Computer Science Department.

LLM RESULT (AgentType.ORCHESTRATOR):
<thinking>
I have received the names and brief credentials of the most notable reinforcement learning professors at McGill University and the University of Toronto from the subagents. At McGill, it is Doina Precup, known for her fundamental research in RL and leadership at DeepMind's Montreal office. At the University of Toronto, it is Jimmy Ba, an associate professor focused on deep learning and RL, trained under Geoffrey Hinton. This information sufficiently answers the user's query.
