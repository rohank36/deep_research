The query involves a historical puzzle: a new coeducational school founded in the 1990s by merging a girls' school and a boys' school in a town with origins going back to the late 19th century. The new school received a Latin name. The question specifically asks for the name of the girls’ school that was part of this merger.

To answer this, I must trace the following information:
1. Identify the new coeducational school founded in the 1990s with a Latin name formed by combining boys' and girls' schools.
2. Confirm the town with the relevant historical background from the late 19th century.
3. From this, identify the original girls' school name before the merger.

This requires connecting historical and educational records about schools with Latin-derived names established in the 1990s by merger, and the origins of the component schools.

Given the complexity and distinct nature of the two main components — identity of the new school and genealogy of the girls’ school — I will deploy two subagents in parallel:

Subagent 1: Research the new coeducational school founded in the 1990s with a Latin name, focusing on which girls' school and boys' school merged to form it.
Subagent 2: Research the historical girls' schools in the town with a history dating to the second half of the 19th century, to identify possible girls' school names that could have merged into the new school.

Results from both will help us verify and pinpoint the exact name of the girls’ school merged into the new school.

Proceeding to dispatch these two subagents in parallel.

I am launching two focused research tasks in parallel: one to identify the new coeducational school with a Latin name founded in the 1990s and its antecedents, and the other to investigate historical girls' schools in the relevant town from the late 19th century. This will help me determine the name of the girls’ school.

The task is to investigate girls' schools founded in the second half of the 19th century in a historically significant town, with the aim of identifying potential schools that might have merged during the 1990s to form a new co-ed school. To proceed:

1. Define or find a historically significant town with a strong history related to girls' education in the second half of the 19th century.
2. Search for girls' schools founded in that town during that time (from 1850 to 1900).
3. Look into the histories of these schools to see if any of them merged or combined in the 1990s to create a new co-ed institution.
4. Gather details about the names, foundation dates, merger years, and any new school formed.

Since the town isn't specified, I will start with a search query around historically strong towns with girls' schools founded in the late 1800s and any mergers in the 1990s that led to co-ed schools. This should yield relevant URLs to explore.

The first subagent has identified the coeducational school founded in the 1990s with a Latin name as Harvard-Westlake School, formed by merging the Harvard School for boys and the Westlake School for girls. The second subagent provided contextual information about similar mergers of girls' schools founded in the second half of the 19th century, but did not name a specific school.

Since the first subagent has directly answered the query with the name of the girls' school involved in the merger, I have sufficient information to answer the user's question: The girls’ school that merged to form the new coeducational school was named Westlake School.
