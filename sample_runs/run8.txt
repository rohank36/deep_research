Q: List all professors at McGill university currently working/researching on AI alignment


LLM RESULT (AgentType.ORCHESTRATOR):
<thinking>
The query asks for a list of professors at McGill University who are currently working or researching AI alignment. This is a specific and focused topic requiring depth-first search: gathering detailed information on a particular subject within a defined university.

To answer this:
1. I need to find the professors at McGill University involved with or researching AI alignment.
2. AI alignment is a specialized subfield in AI research, so these professors may belong to departments such as computer science, cognitive science, or related interdisciplinary centers.
3. I should search for recent faculty research interests, recent publications, or affiliations linked to AI alignment.
4. Since the query is specific and the topic might be niche, I will run a subagent tasked with compiling a current list of McGill professors actively researching AI alignment.

I will instruct a subagent to find and list the professors at McGill University who are currently working in AI alignment, including their department and relevant research interests.

LLM RESULT (AgentType.WORKER):
<thinking>
To identify professors at McGill University who are currently working or researching on AI alignment, I will first search for relevant information on McGill professors involved with AI alignment. This will include looking for faculty pages, research group pages, and any AI-related institutes or labs within McGill University. I will look for mentions of AI alignment specifically, or strongly related research topics such as AI safety, ethical AI, robust AI, or similar concepts that indicate alignment focus. Once I identify relevant professors, I will compile their names, departments, and research interests/projects relevant to AI alignment.

LLM RESULT (AgentType.WORKER):
<thinking>
From the iSMART Lab team page, the main professor is Dr. Narges Armanfard, Associate Professor in Electrical and Computer Engineering and affiliated with Mila. Her research is AI-focused, but there is no explicit mention of AI alignment or related terms like AI safety or robust AI. The other team members mostly focus on AI applications such as anomaly detection, computer vision, reinforcement learning, and large language models, but none explicitly mention AI alignment or AI safety. This page does not show direct AI alignment research involvement or professor names with AI alignment as a primary focus.

Next, I should examine other URLs, especially Mila's directory and McGill's computer science faculty pages, since AI alignment experts might be affiliated primarily with computer science or Mila. I will fetch content from the Mila directory for Blake Richards and the McGill CS faculty page next.

The challenge of hidden gifts in multi-agent reinforcement learning
Dane Malenfant
Blake Richards
Cooperation between people is not always obvious. Sometimes we benefit from actions that others have taken even when we are unaware that the

y took those actions. For example, if your neighbor chooses not to take a parking spot in front of your house when you are not there, you can benefit, even without being aware that they took this action. These “hidden gifts” represent an interesting challenge for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), since assigning credit to your own actions correctly when the beneficial actions of others are hidden is non-trivial. Here, we study the impact of hidden gifts with a very simple MARL task. In this task, agents in a grid-world environment have individual doors to unlock in order to obtain individual rewards. As well, if all the agents unlock their door the group receives a larger collective reward. However, there is only one key for all of the doors, such that the collective reward can only be obtained when the agents drop the key for others after they use it. Notably, there is nothing to indicate to an agent that the other agents have dropped the key, thus the act of dropping the key for others is a “hidden gift”. We show that several different state-of-the-art RL algorithms, including MARL algorithms, fail to learn how to obtain the collective reward in this simple task. Interestingly, we find that independent model-free policy gradient agents can solve the task when we provide them with information about their action history, but MARL agents still cannot solve the task with action history. Finally, we derive a correction term for these independent agents, inspired by learning aware approaches, which reduces the variance in learning and helps them to converge to collective success more reliably. These results show how credit assignment in multi-agent settings can be particularly challenging in the presence of “hidden gifts”, and demonstrate that learning awareness can benefit these settings

With the OLMo and Pythia model families we uncover a consistent non-monotonic sequence of three distinct geometric phases in pretraining. An initial \warmup phase sees rapid representational compression. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase, characterized by expansion of the representation manifold's effective dimensionality, which correlates with an increase in memorization. Subsequently, a "compression seeking" phase imposes anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant eigendirections while contracting others, correlating with improved downstream task performance. We link the emergence of these phases to the fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization, information bottleneck, and skewed data distribution. Additionally, we find that in post-training the representation geometry is further transformed: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) correlate with another "entropy-seeking" dynamic to integrate specific instructional or preferential data, reducing out-of-distribution robustness. Conversely, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) often exhibits a "compression seeking" dynamic, consolidating reward-aligned behaviors and reducing the entropy in its output distribution. This work establishes the utility of spectral measures of representation geometry for understanding the multiphase learning dynamics within LLMs.

ons. A crucial cognitive skill for such agents is the efficient exploration and understanding of the causal structure of the world -- key to robust, scientifically grounded reasoning. Yet, it remains unclear whether LMs possess this capability or exhibit systematic biases leading to erroneous conclusions. In this work, we examine LMs' ability to explore and infer causal relationships, using the well-established"Blicket Test"paradigm from developmental psychology. We find that LMs reliably infer the common, intuitive disjunctive causal relationships but systematically struggle with the unusual, yet equally (or sometimes even more) evidenced conjunctive ones. This"disjunctive bias"persists across model families, sizes, and prompting strategies, and performance further declines as task complexity increases. Interestingly, an analogous bias appears in human adults, suggesting that LMs may have inherited deep-seated reasoning heuristics from their training data. To this end, we quantify similarities between LMs and humans, finding that LMs exhibit adult-like inference profiles (but not children-like). Finally, we propose a test-time sampling method which explicitly samples and eliminates hypotheses about causal relationships from the LM. This scalable approach significantly reduces the disjunctive bias and moves LMs closer to the goal of scientific, causally rigorous reasoning.

ve helped address in language, but which remains underexplored in vision. We address this gap by training SAEs on CLIP's vision transformer and uncover key differences between vision and language processing, including distinct sparsity patterns for SAEs trained across layers and token types. We then provide the first systematic analysis of the steerability of CLIP's vision transformer by introducing metrics to quantify how precisely SAE features can be steered to affect the model's output. We find that 10-15% of neurons and features are steerable, with SAEs providing thousands more steerable features than the base model. Through targeted suppression of SAE features, we then demonstrate improved performance on three vision disentanglement tasks (CelebA, Waterbirds, and typographic attacks), finding optimal disentanglement in middle model layers, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on defense against typographic attacks. We release our CLIP SAE models and code to support future research in vision transformer interpretability.

among self-interested, independent learning agents? Promising recent work has shown that in certain tasks cooperation can be established between learning-aware agents who model the learning dynamics of each other. Here, we present the first unbiased, higher-derivative-free policy gradient algorithm for learning-aware reinforcement learning, which takes into account that other agents are themselves learning through trial and error based on multiple noisy trials. We then leverage efficient sequence models to condition behavior on long observation histories that contain traces of the learning dynamics of other agents. Training long-context policies with our algorithm leads to cooperative behavior and high returns on standard social dilemmas, including a challenging environment where temporally-extended action coordination is required. Finally, we derive from the iterated prisoner's dilemma a novel explanation for how and when cooperation arises among self-interested learning-aware agents.

ge-scale decoding across many different datasets is challenging because neural circuits are heterogeneous---each brain region contains a unique mix of cellular sub-types, and the responses to different stimuli are diverse across regions and sub-types. It is unknown whether it is possible to pre-train and transfer brain decoding models between distinct tasks, cellular sub-types, and brain regions. To address these questions, we developed a multi-task transformer architecture and trained it on the entirety of the Allen Institute's Brain Observatory dataset. This dataset contains responses from over 100,000 neurons in 6 areas of the brains of mice, observed with two-photon calcium imaging, recorded while the mice observed different types of visual stimuli. Our results demonstrate that transfer is indeed possible -combining data from different sources is beneficial for a number of downstream decoding tasks. As well, we can transfer the model between regions and sub-types, demonstrating that there is in fact common information in diverse circuits that can be extracted by an appropriately designed model. Interestingly, we found that the model's latent representations showed clear distinctions between different brain regions and cellular sub-types, even though it was never given any information about these distinctions. Altogether, our work demonstrates that training a large-scale neural decoding model on diverse data is possible, and this provides a means of studying the differences and similarities between heterogeneous neural circuits.

The oneirogen hypothesis: modeling the hallucinatory effects of classical psychedelics in terms of replay-dependent plasticity mechanisms

surreal, dream-like qualities at a high level. While there are many hypotheses as to how classical psychedelics could induce these effects, there are no concrete mechanistic models that capture the variety of observed effects in humans, while remaining consistent with the known pharmacological effects of classical psychedelics on neural circuits. In this work, we propose the “oneirogen hypothesis”, which posits that the perceptual effects of classical psychedelics are a result of their pharmacological actions inducing neural activity states that truly are more similar to dream-like states. We simulate classical psychedelics’ effects via manipulating neural network models trained on perceptual tasks with the Wake-Sleep algorithm. This established machine learning algorithm leverages two activity phases, a perceptual phase (wake) where sensory inputs are encoded, and a generative phase (dream) where the network internally generates activity consistent with stimulus-evoked responses. We simulate the action of psychedelics by partially shifting the model to the ‘Sleep’ state, which entails a greater influence of top-down connections, in line with the impact of psychedelics on apical dendrites. The effects resulting from this manipulation capture a number of experimentally observed phenomena including the emergence of hallucinations, increases in stimulus-conditioned variability, and large increases in synaptic plasticity. We further provide a number of testable predictions which could be used to validate or invalidate our oneirogen hypothesis.

Top-down feedback matters: Functional impact of brainlike connectivity motifs on audiovisual integration

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are an important tool for studying neural computation, but many features of the brain are not captured by
… (

standard ANN architectures. One notable missing feature in most ANN models is top-down feedback, i.e. projections from higher-order layers to lower-order layers in the network. Top-down feedback is ubiquitous in the brain, and it has a unique modulatory impact on activity in neocortical pyramidal neurons. However, we still do not understand its computational role. Here we develop a deep neural network model that captures the core functional properties of top-down feedback in the neocortex, allowing us to construct hierarchical recurrent ANN models that more closely reflect the architecture of the brain. We use this to explore the impact of different hierarchical recurrent architectures on an audiovisual integration task. We find that certain hierarchies, namely those that mimic the architecture of the human brain, impart ANN models with a light visual bias similar to that seen in humans. This bias does not impair performance on the audiovisual tasks. The results further suggest that different configurations of top-down feedback make otherwise identically connected models functionally distinct from each other, and from traditional feedforward-only models. Altogether our findings demonstrate that modulatory top-down feedback is a computationally relevant feature of biological brains, and that incorporating it into ANNs can affect their behavior and helps to determine the solutions that the network can discover.

LLM RESULT (AgentType.WORKER):
Blake Richards is an Associate Professor at McGill University (School of Computer Science and Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery) and a core academic member of Mila – Quebec AI Institute. His research lies at the intersection of neuroscience and AI, investigating universal principles of intelligence that apply to both natural and artificial agents. The content does not specifically mention AI alignment or AI safety, but some research topics such as reinforcement learning, representation learning, and multi-agent cooperation reflect foundational AI research relevant to alignment-related questions.

Next, I will fetch content from the McGill Faculty of Computer Science page to identify other professors that may explicitly work in AI alignment or related safety and alignment research areas, as such researchers often come from computer science faculties.

LLM RESULT (AgentType.WORKER):
<thinking>
The content from Blake Richards' Mila directory page shows that he is an Associate Professor at McGill University and a core member of Mila. His research is at the intersection of neuroscience and AI, focusing on universal principles of intelligence for natural and artificial agents. However, explicit mention of AI alignment or AI safety is not directly stated, though some work on multi-agent cooperation and learning-aware reinforcement learning might be related. Next, I should check the McGill Computer Science faculty page and the page for Joelle Pineau at McGill and Mila, as she is known for fundamental AI research that could include AI alignment topics. I will fetch the Computer Science faculty page content next.
</thinking>
<text>
I have reviewed Blake Richards' research profile, which primarily focuses on computational neuroscience and AI, with some relevant work on multi-agent coordination, which is somewhat related to AI alignment themes. I will now look at the broader McGill Computer Science faculty faculty to identify other professors with AI alignment or related AI safety research.

LLM RESULT (AgentType.WORKER):
<thinking>
I reviewed the McGill Computer Science faculty page. It lists many professors with research areas including machine learning, artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning, robotics, and neuroscience. Several professors have expertise which could potentially relate to AI alignment, such as Joelle Pineau (machine learning, robotics), Doina Precup (machine learning), Blake Richards (machine learning, neuroscience, brain-inspired AI), David Rolnick (machine learning, deep learning theory, climate change), and Joseph Vybihal (brain-inspired AI and societal impacts of AI). However, the page does not explicitly mention AI alignment or AI safety research directly in these short summaries. Joelle Pineau is a known figure in AI research with a leadership role at Mila and Meta's FAIR, so I should further check her specific page for alignment-related work. I will fetch the content from Joelle Pineau’s faculty page next.

I reviewed the McGill Computer Science faculty page for professors potentially researching AI alignment. Several professors such as Joelle Pineau, Doina Precup, Blake Richards, and David Rolnick have relevant AI and machine learning expertise, but AI alignment or safety is not explicitly mentioned in their short bios. To identify any direct AI alignment work, I will now check Joelle Pineau’s specific faculty or Mila page for detailed research interests and projects.

She is a past President of the International Machine Learning Society, the inaugural Reproducibility Chair of the NeurIPS conference, and is the creator of the ML Reproducibility checklist and the ML Reproducibility challenge. She is a recipient of NSERC's E.W.R. Steacie Memorial Fellowship (2018), the Governor General's Innovation Awards (2019), a CIFAR Canada AI (CCAI) chair-holder, a Fellow of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (RSC).




LLM RESULT (AgentType.WORKER):
<thinking>
Joelle Pineau is a Professor of Computer Science at McGill and a core member of Mila, with a strong leadership role in AI research at Meta. Her research focuses broadly on developing new models and algorithms for planning and learning with applications in robotics, healthcare, and conversational agents, but there is no explicit mention of AI alignment or AI safety in the description. The information from the iSMART lab and Blake Richards does not explicitly reference AI alignment either. The McGill CS faculty list included several other professors with machine learning and AI expertise who might have AI alignment interests, but none explicitly listed that. To be exhaustive, I should check if there are any known AI alignment research initiatives or groups directly affiliated with McGill or Mila that might mention professors specifically in that niche.

Next, I will search for "McGill University AI alignment researchers" and for any AI safety or alignment research groups associated with McGill, to see if there are explicit mentions of professors working on AI alignment.
</thinking>
<text>
I will now perform a search to identify if there are any McGill University professors explicitly working on or researching AI alignment or AI safety, which might not be listed directly in the faculty or lab pages but are mentioned in broader or external sources related to AI alignment.

LLM RESULT (AgentType.WORKER):
<thinking>
I have reviewed multiple sources related to McGill University professors connected to AI research, including the iSMART Lab, Mila directory, and McGill Computer Science faculty page. None explicitly mentioned professors specifically focused on AI alignment or AI safety research. Based on major known AI alignment experts and common affiliations, it appears McGill may not have professors publicly emphasizing AI alignment as a core research area, at least in the mainstream faculty profiles or Mila directory. However, I see from a new link mentioning Canada CIFAR AI Chairs at McGill, which could be leading AI researchers potentially tangentially related to AI alignment. I should fetch the content of the last link from McGill Reporter on Canada CIFAR AI Chairs to check if any of the professors selected are working in areas related to AI alignment.

LLM RESULT (AgentType.WORKER):
<thinking>
I reviewed the article on McGill's recent appointments to Canada CIFAR AI Chairs. Two professors were highlighted: Derek Nowrouzezahrai (Electrical and Computer Engineering) and Adriana Romero Soriano (Computer Science). Derek focuses on diverse applications including reinforcement learning and robotics but no explicit AI alignment mention. Adriana's work includes generative modeling, active sensing, and responsible AI, which overlaps somewhat with AI safety or alignment themes. Given this, she may be involved in AI alignment-related research. Past fetched content showed several other professors with AI-related interests (e.g., Joelle Pineau, Blake Richards, Doina Precup) but none explicitly listed AI alignment. I did not find explicit titles using "AI alignment" but there are overlaps with responsible AI and safety-related research. Thus, I can summarize professors working in AI and adjacent areas potentially related to AI alignment, but no clear explicit AI alignment specialists were found.
</thinking>
<text>
Here are McGill University professors currently working on AI-related areas relevant or adjacent to AI alignment:

1. Adriana Romero Soriano
   - Department: School of Computer Science
   - Relevant Research: Machine learning models for multi-modal data, conceptual reasoning, active and adaptive data acquisition, generative modeling, and responsible AI. Her work on responsible AI suggests involvement in AI safety and alignment adjacent topics.

2. Blake Richards
   - Departments: School of Computer Science; Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery
   - Relevant Research: Neuroscience and AI intersection, brain-inspired AI, reinforcement learning, multi-agent cooperation, and learning-aware algorithms which can relate to AI alignment themes.

3. Joelle Pineau
   - Department: School of Computer Science
   - Relevant Research: Planning and learning in complex domains, robotics, healthcare, conversational agents; leader at Mila and Meta FAIR. While no explicit AI alignment mention, her role involves fundamental AI research.

4. Doina Precup
   - Department: School of Computer Science
   - Relevant Research: Machine learning, particularly reinforcement learning, a field closely tied with AI alignment research.

5. Derek Nowrouzezahrai
   - Department: Electrical and Computer Engineering
   - Relevant Research: Mathematical models in reinforcement learning, robotics, and control. His work includes reinforcement learning, which can be related to alignment.

Although none of the professors explicitly list "AI alignment" as their primary focus, several engage in research areas such as reinforcement learning, responsible AI, and multi-agent systems which are relevant to AI alignment themes.

Narges Armanfard from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Mila is an AI-focused professor, but her research centers on applied computer vision and anomaly detection rather than AI alignment.

In summary, McGill University has several AI researchers whose work touches on areas relevant to AI alignment, but explicit concentrated AI alignment research or professors designated specifically as AI alignment researchers does not appear evident in publicly available information.
