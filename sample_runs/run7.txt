Q: Im free august 15 to september 15, tell me the best holiday I could take in dubrovnik croatia and also tell me the best flights I could get from toronto and give the recommendation of 5 hotels


LLM RESULT (AgentType.ORCHESTRATOR):
<thinking>
The USER asks for a holiday suggestion in Dubrovnik, Croatia, including the best flights from Toronto and recommendations for 5 hotels. This query has three distinct parts: 1) the best holiday experience in Dubrovnik between August 15 and September 15, 2) best flights from Toronto to Dubrovnik within those dates, and 3) the best 5 hotels in Dubrovnik.

Since the query has distinct independent parts (holiday suggestions, flights, hotels), I will follow a breadth-first-search approach by delegating three subagents to gather information in parallel: one on the best holiday experiences in Dubrovnik during that timeframe, one on the best flights from Toronto to Dubrovnik, and one on the best hotels in Dubrovnik.

Combining these three gathered outputs will allow me to deliver a complete answer for the user.
</thinking>
<text>
I will start by gathering the best holiday experiences you can enjoy in Dubrovnik, Croatia from August 15 to September 15, the best flights available from Toronto to Dubrovnik in that period, and the top 5 hotel recommendations in Dubrovnik. I will retrieve this information shortly.

A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.

If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

The best hotels in Dubrovnik, Croatia for 2025
Whether you choose to stay within the city walls or in leafier pastures just outside, this is our pick of the best hotels in Dubrovnik

Whether it was
Game of Thrones
that catapulted Dubrovnik into the spotlight or the arrival of the
cruise ships
and new and more frequent flight routes – or a combination of all three – one thing’s for certain: the city is having a moment and the best hotels in Dubrovnik are arguably some of the most authentic places to stay in
Croatia
.
When it comes to accommodation, any visitor will need to ask themselves the same question: to stay within the city walls or outside? Within the walls, you have the benefit of pedestrianised streets, and a cluster of boutique boltholes and converted palaces brimming with period charm. Centuries of history are condensed into a warren of limestone streets, where ancient walls wrap around Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque buildings, many of which have survived wars, fires and earthquakes. The scars of disaster are never far, for those who know where to look.
Staying outside the Old Town is generally a quieter, leafier affair, and many resorts along the coast have direct beach access. Lapad is where the larger names tend to congregate, and is a good bet for nature lovers, with forests, hikes and emerald waters at your feet. To sidestep the crowds, visit in spring or autumn, when the streets are quieter, the Adriatic is warm enough for a swim and the Old Town is comfortably walkable. Or take your cue from the original visitors and come in winter, when the city is at its cosiest – and arguably, its most romantic. This is our pick of the best hotels in Dubrovnik.

Hotel Bellevue
Sitting on a rocky bluff, Hotel Bellevue is in a prime location, walkable to both the historic centre and Lapad, and with direct access to a secluded cove below. Portuguese designer Tereza Prego created fresh, modern interiors for the 77 rooms and 14 suites, with nods to the city’s maritime history. Natural materials abound – from the wooden floors and stone accents to the dove-grey and soft blue textiles that mirror the seascape beyond. Many rooms come with suntrap terraces that look out to the pine-studded cliffs and dazzling Adriatic. A lift will whisk you down to pebbly Plaža Bellevue – a small beach that remains almost empty in off-season, save for the few die-hard winter swimmers, and offers private space with sunbeds for guests in summer’s peak.
The spa, with its heated freshwater pool and floor-to-ceiling windows, makes a compelling case for an afternoon indoors, but the real magic unfolds at mealtimes. From the Spice Lounge where you can enjoy a well-mixed grappa, to Nevera’s cave dining room that’s pure atmosphere, you’ll not be short of places to unwind. If the sun gods are on your side, grab a table at Vapor’s terrace in time for sunset. The fine dining restaurant is one of the best in Dubrovnik, with a diverse and flavourful selection of dishes such as Adriatic fish ceviche, wild mushroom risotto and St Jacques scallops. The adjoining wine bar offers tastings, and staff are adept at recommending Croatian wines to pair with your meal.

Hotel Kazbek
At the seafront in Gruž, a 10-minute drive from the city walls, this heritage hotel is a handy place to bed down if you’re coming to or from the Split, Korcula, Mljet or Hvar ferries. Built in 1573, as the summer residence of the noble Zamanja family, it was bought by the Swedish investment company Pervanovo, who renovated the property back to its former glory. The 12 elegantly furnished rooms and one suite have a classic style and feature king-size beds, polished wood floors and furnishings, and exposed beams. Bathrooms have heated floors, bath tubs and refillable Thierry Mugler amenities. There’s also a sauna and outdoor pool.
The Balcony Terrace is ideal for cocktails overlooking Gruž Bay before heading down to the Kazbek restaurant for Croatian specialties made from fresh and locally grown ingredients under a stone vaulted ceiling. On warm days, you can dine outside at the Courtyard Terrace surrounded by lush Mediterranean gardens. This is also where breakfast is served, so you can soak up the morning sun while enjoying your eggs and coffee.

Heritage Villa Nobile
Tucked just outside the city walls, on a side street near Pile Gate, Heritage Villa Nobile is the best of both worlds – modern yet historic, central yet secluded. Once the home of an affluent intellectual and notable pianist, Maria Rubricius, and her husband, the doctor Jero Pugliesi, the house remained in the same family for three generations. After a brief change of hands, it was then bought by current owners Tina and Stipe Milisic, who thoughtfully renovated it into the high-end boutique property you see today.
The six bedrooms pay homage to Maria and Dr Pugliesi and their circle of friends, with names such as the Captain’s Room, the Doctor’s Room, and the Artist’s Room. Tina delved into the archives to research the villa’s former inhabitants and bring their history to life. Throughout the hotel, small cabinets display their personal effects.
Bedrooms have state-of-the-art tech such as underfloor heating, touch lighting, minibar and Nespresso coffee machine. Interiors are tasteful and stylish, with shades of pale grey and white, natural stone walls, mottled glass mirrors and restored antique furnishings. The Musician's Room, on the ground floor, which contains a piano, is where Maria and Dr Pugliesi used to host their regular Monday night soirées, which would attract visitors from the nearby Grand Imperial Hotel (now the Hilton), who would drift in after hearing the music while out on their evening walk.
Breakfast is served in the front garden – a little oasis of calm, with orange trees and old Japanese Sago palms, where mornings begin with a continental tray of cold meats, cheeses and fruits, and evenings can be enjoyed with a glass of wine. With its strict over-16s policy, this is a refined retreat for those seeking a grown-up escape.

Hotel Dubrovnik Palace
Perched on the edge of the bucolic Lapad Peninsula, amid Aleppo pines, cypresses and ancient olive groves, Hotel Dubrovnik Palace is a sleek, modern hotel far from the madding crowds. Open year round, this makes a great winter break as well as summer holiday spot—especially with its private beach and PADI diving centre, so you can make the most of the coastal location. Spanning 10 floors, the 308 rooms and suites all enjoy west-facing sea views, and floor-to-ceiling windows throughout the resort ensure the scenery takes centre stage.
Part of the Adriatic Luxury Hotels collection, which also includes Hotel Bellevue, Dubrovnik Palace was built in 1972 but underwent a full renovation in 2014 to bring it up to date. Architects 3LHD worked with Grupa Studio, furniture makers Prostoria, artist Mare Šuljak and fashion designers from Studio I-GLE to create a stylish and contemporary decor. The result is a Scandi-inspired aesthetic, with mid-century modern-inspired furnishings and a colour palette that takes its cue from the surrounding seascape – teal blues, slate greys and whites, with pops of mustard yellow. The bathtubs are a big plus, especially in cooler months, and toiletries are by Barcelona brand, Natura Bissé. The VIP wing has its own private entrance and features four zen-like suites with private balconies for complete seclusion. Their oak and elm interiors give them a Japanese feel, with sliding doors to maximise space.
The spa offers everything from Thalgo cold cream facials to hot stone massages. It also has an 18-metre indoor pool, two jacuzzis, steam rooms, saunas and a sea-view gym with panoramic Adriatic vistas.
In summer, all four restaurants and two bars serve a mix of lavish buffets and à la carte. Come winter, this scales down to the Elafiti buffet. Maslina Tavern – which does fabulous contemporary Dalmatian cuisine – and the Sunset Lounge, where guests and visitors alike enjoy sundowners with the best views in town.

Pucić Palace
Once home to the aristocratic Pucić family – a cultured coterie of poets, politicians, and artists – this Baroque palazzo is the place to bed down if you want to immerse yourself in the Old Town’s history. Waking up to the chatter of the daily food market and the sound of the cathedral bells is the most Dubrovnikan experience there can be. Thankfully, this is one such establishment that remains open year-round, so you can take advantage of the quieter months, when the city feels more peaceful and authentic.
The 18 rooms ooze old-world charm, with original timber beams, antique telephones, drinks cabinets, writing desks, and copper slipper baths—it’s rather like stepping into an Agatha Christie novel. Bulgari toiletries, Dammann Frères teas, and Nespresso machines bring a touch of luxury. The Deluxe Suite has an in-room jacuzzi, or make like Romeo and Juliet and book one of the first-floor suites for their stone balconies that overlook Gundulić Square and the Jesuit Stairs. This was also the setting for the opening sequence of David Tennant’s 2005 film,
Casanova
. The staff, who all hail from Dubrovnik, make Pucić Palace feel like a home-from-home. They know the city inside and out, and will happily book transfers, curate a personal walking tour with local travel expert Ivan Vuković (AKA Vuka), or simply share stories about this historic space.
On sunny days, once the daily food market packs away, Restaurant Lucijan spills out onto the square, and visitors linger over Adriatic seafood and Dalmatian classics such as the
rožata
– a rose liqueur-infused crème caramel. But for something truly special, head upstairs to Restaurant Magdalena, where the Baroque Chapel and terrace set the stage for candlelit dinners under the stars.

St Joseph’s
Hidden away on a narrow street within the city walls, this 400-year-old townhouse has just six rooms, making it feel like you’re staying with a friend. The whole property has been tastefully renovated, blending original 16th-century features – stone walls, timber beams – with elegant décor and 21st-century creature comforts. Bathrooms are sleek and spacious, with walk-in rain showers or, in the King Suites, deep bathtubs and twin sinks. But the best bit is that every room is kitted out with a discreet kitchenette featuring an induction hob, whisper-quiet fridge, and either a microwave or an oven, meaning you don’t have to venture out to eat if you don’t want to. Either way, your mornings will begin with a full breakfast served in-room—don’t leave without trying the signature St. Joseph’s green smoothie.
A few steps away, at number 6, sits its quieter, self-contained sibling: St. Joseph’s Cottage. This 13th-century family residence is a more secluded affair, offering guests the best of both worlds: the privacy of their own historic abode, with all the benefits of a well-run guesthouse just moments away. Three bedrooms, each with an en-suite featuring an antique-style rain shower, are spread across the house – two with full-height ceilings, the third a cosy attic space with sloping walls and period charm. Breakfast here is communal, served in the cottage’s open-plan kitchen, so you can chat to the other guests over coffee.

Hilton Imperial Dubrovnik
When it opened in the winter of 1897, the Grand Hotel Imperial was the city’s first purpose-built hotel, designed to serve passengers arriving off the steamships touring the Adriatic, back when Dubrovnik was a winter destination rather than a summon one – the opposite of today. It has remained a Dubrovnikan institution ever since, hosting many notable guests, from royalty to politicians and dignitaries. King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson danced and drank tea in the garden in the summer of 1936.
After the building was shelled during the Homelands War in 1991, when it served as a refugee camp, it was completely revamped to become a hotel once again. Then in 2018, London interior design studio Goddard Littlefair gave it a 21st-century facelift, preserving its period features and reinjecting a dose of Art Deco elegance. The result is a hotel reminiscent of a glamorous ocean liner and an homage to the golden age of travel. 149 guest rooms and nine suites have a stylish duck-egg blue and teal colour scheme, brass vintage-style fittings, scallop motifs and herringbone oak floors.
Partaking in afternoon tea or cocktail hour at the Imperial Bar and Lobby Lounge is a must, as is enjoying a meal downstairs at the Imperial Restaurant. Breakfast is also served here, or in the garden under the shade of magnolias and palms, and sunbeds are laid out on the deck in summer months. There’s a small spa and indoor pool for less clement days. Business travellers are well served, with five meeting and conference spaces, and the Executive Lounge, which has complimentary drinks and snacks, plus a popular happy hour. The location doesn’t get much better either – you’re mere steps from Pile Gate and the old walls. And if you’re lucky enough to stay in one of the top-floor suites, you have the addition of a sun-filled terrace with unparalleled city and sea views.

Bota Palace
With a prime location right on the Stradun, the main thoroughfare in the historic centre, this modern transformation of the 18th-century Caboga Palace is the work of the Šare family, the force behind the acclaimed Bota Šare restaurants and oyster bars in Dubrovnik, Split, Zagreb and Mali Ston.
Inside, five thoughtfully designed rooms strike a balance between old and new, with original stone walls and wooden floors offset by striking paintings by Dubrovnik-based artist, Tonko Smokvina. Two of the rooms feature bathtubs, while the attic studio has a small kitchen with oven and dishwasher – perfect for those who prefer to self-cater. Thoughtful touches, from in-room hair straighteners to refillable Rituals amenities, a well-stocked minibar, and Nespresso machines, add to the experience. Breakfast is delivered to your door – a choice of Dalmatian toast, French toast, omelette, or a classic continental spread made with local, organic ingredients – so you don’t need to head out to refuel. And there’s a bottle of cherry brandy on the communal sideboard for late-night tipples.

Palace Natali
At the top of a flight of stone steps at the base of Mount Srđ, adults-only Palace Natali offers superlative views and a tranquil alternative to the hotels in town. One-time summer residence of the wealthy Natali family, the original Renaissance home was meticulously restored according to strict conservation criteria, and now operates as a modern upscale stay with 21 rooms spread across three separate buildings – the converted 16th-century Palace Natali, Olea House and the Capparis Suites.
Inside, the decor marries traditional with modern, with sensitive use of natural materials, stone and wood, brought to life by funky sofas, wall tapestries and playful rugs. The bedrooms have serious wow factor, all stocked with covetable Diptyque amenities, while some even come with private saunas for that extra touch of luxury. Spread across the different buildings are also common areas in which you can play the piano, enjoy a game of chess or shoot some pool. One such room, named the Cabinet of Curiosities, contains a copy of the Statute of Dubrovnik from 1272, which makes for a highly entertaining read. The nice thing about Palace Natali is that it never feels crowded, even when it’s full. In fact, it’s a bit like staying in a big country house – the sense of spaciousness, inside and outside, is incredibly refreshing, especially after a day's sightseeing in the Old Town.
An outdoor pool makes for a serene oasis on hot summer days, and the manicured lawns are dotted with ancient olive trees and swing chairs in which to relax and enjoy the breeze and panoramic views – the benefit of being at this elevation. The garden restaurant serves contemporary Mediterranean cuisine, and a buffet breakfast of pastries, cheeses and made-to-order eggs.

Hotel Kompas
Another leafy Lapad sanctuary – this time in Uvala, at the base of Babin Kuk. Its Sixties retro exterior belies a contemporary, minimalist core, so don’t be deceived by first impressions. As with nearby Dubrovnik Palace, the views at Hotel Kompas take centre stage, and most rooms boast dreamy panoramas that make this Lapad retreat worth its weight in gold. Opt for a Superior Suite for the best vantage point. The 173 rooms, including three suites, were styled by some of Croatia’s leading interior designers, and are light, bright, modern abodes, with a monochrome palette and textiles by Saša Šekoranja. Four rooms are wheelchair-accessible.
Hitting the beach for some serious sunbed time, or lazing by the outdoor pool flanked by pine trees will be the only tough decisions you’ll have to make. Either way, the sunshine will force you to take on a slower pace and get in some Dalmatian
fjaka
, otherwise known as downtime, helped along nicely by the Luna Bar’s on-point cocktails.
Top-floor Zenith Bar is the place to go for local wines and sundowners before heading down to Restaurant Sphere for a Mediterranean dinner – on sultry evenings ask for a table in the garden beneath lantern-lit trees that kick the atmosphere up a notch. This is also the main stage for breakfast, where you’ll have your pick of continental buffet and hot dishes. The spa has a freshwater pool, Finnish sauna and steam room, and there’s a gym for your all-important holiday workouts.

I have detailed flight information from Skyscanner for flights from Toronto to Dubrovnik for various dates mostly around August to October 2025. The flights are indirect with one stop, operated by a range of airlines like Air Transat, Ryanair, Porter Airlines, Lufthansa, WestJet, and others. Prices range from about CAD $710 to over CAD $1,000 for round-trip economy. The cheapest found is CAD $710, departing in mid-October, but for the user's requested August 15 to September 15 period, prices start around CAD $743 up to about CAD $951 or more. There are no direct flights. I will fetch content from the other relevant flight search sites (Momondo, Google Flights, Flight Centre) to compare prices, flight times, and airlines for this same date range.

The content from the first link provides a comprehensive list of cultural events and festivals in Dubrovnik, many of which occur during the summer months. Important to note is that the Dubrovnik Summer Festival runs until the end of August, so it overlaps with the requested date range (Aug 15 - Sept 15). The Dubrovnik Wine & Jazz Festival takes place in late September, just after the date range but close enough to mention as it could influence the local atmosphere. Other noted events like the Maritime Festival, Ragusa’s Fair, and Traditional Summer Music Evenings are relevant cultural experiences. Several of these events also touch on culinary experiences and local heritage, which is useful.

Next, I will check the other links focused on specific festivals, culinary events, and activities happening around the specified period to get detailed culinary and outdoor adventure options, plus any other cultural highlights specific to late August and September.

I will proceed to fetch the content from the second URL, which should elaborate on unique festivals throughout the year in Dubrovnik.

I have gathered detailed information about Dubrovnik’s key cultural festivals and events, especially those occurring in the late summer period, including the Dubrovnik Summer Festival (ending late August) and the Wine & Jazz Festival (late September). There are also notable cultural activities such as the Maritime Festival, Ragusa’s Fair, and Traditional Summer Music Evenings.

Next, I will check additional sources to find more details on festivals, culinary experiences, and outdoor adventures specific to the August 15 to September 15 period.

LLM RESULT (AgentType.WORKER):
<thinking>
The content from the first URL (the Conde Nast Traveller article) provides an extensive list of high-quality hotels in Dubrovnik with detailed descriptions of their location, quality, and amenities, including historical relevance and user-attracting features. However, the content is lengthy, so I will focus on extracting the top-highlighted hotels with reasons why they stand out in Dubrovnik. Next, I will fetch content from the other URLs (Tripadvisor, The Tour Guy, U.S. News, and the Luxury Hotel Guru) to include more perspectives, user reviews, and rankings so I can compare and finalize a top 5 list for the user.

<text>
I have gathered detailed information on several of the best hotels in Dubrovnik from a respected travel publication.

Dubrovnik's Unique Festivals
Dubrovnik's Unique Festivals
D
ubrovnik’s festivals offer a year-round calendar of cultural, culinary, and celebratory events.
From the lively spirit of the carnival to the reverence of St. Blaise Day, and from the artistic splendour of the Summer Festival to the festive warmth of the Winter Festival, there is something for everyone to enjoy. For travellers, timing a visit to coincide with these festivals adds an extra layer of enchantment to their Dubrovnik experience.
Dubrovnik Carnival
Dubrovnik Carnival, held every February, is a vibrant celebration of tradition, colour, and music. The festival, mainly focused on children and youth, features lively parades through the historic streets, creative costumes, and captivating performances. A highlight is the grand masquerade ball, where attendees embrace the elegance of past eras. Food lovers can enjoy seasonal treats like
fritule
, adding to the festive spirit. Set against Dubrovnik’s stunning backdrop, the carnival offers an unforgettable blend of history, entertainment, and local charm.
The Festival of St. Blaise
No celebration in Dubrovnik is as deeply rooted in the city’s identity as the
Festival of St. Blaise
. Held on 3rd February, this festival honours St. Blaise, the city’s patron saint, who is credited with protecting Dubrovnik during times of crisis. The celebration begins with the raising of St. Blaise’s flag in front of the Church of St. Blaise, accompanied by a solemn procession through the city’s streets. Pilgrims from surrounding areas join Dubrovnik’s residents, carrying relics and banners as they pay homage to the saint. Traditional folk costumes, music, and rituals lend a sense of timelessness to the occasion.
A highlight of the celebration is the blessing of throats, a ritual linked to St. Blaise’s reputation as a protector against throat illnesses. Locals and visitors queue to receive this blessing, a tradition that reinforces the community’s spiritual connection to their patron saint. Beyond the religious ceremonies, the festival is a time for communal gatherings, with feasts, concerts, and cultural events filling the week. The entire city comes alive, reflecting the pride and unity of its people.
Dubrovnik Musical Spring (Dubrovnik Symphony Orchestra)
Each April and May, locals and visitors can enjoy a curated selection of concerts across Dubrovnik, including performances for children. In recent years, over 30 renowned soloists, conductors, and artists have taken part, celebrating the city’s rich musical heritage.
Midsummer Scene
Midsummer Scene
is an established English-language theatre festival held at Dubrovnik’s stunning Lovrjenac Fortress. It brings Shakespeare’s plays to life through collaborations between British and Croatian theatre artists, attracting an international audience.
Dubrovnik Summer Festival
Running from mid-July to late August, the
Dubrovnik Summer Festival
is a world-renowned event that showcases the best of culture under the beautiful Dubrovnik backdrop. For over 70 years, this festival has transformed Dubrovnik into a grand stage, with its historic streets, squares, and fortresses serving as stunning backdrops for theatre performances, classical concerts, opera, ballet, and exhibitions.
International and local artists come together to present a diverse programme that caters to all tastes. Whether you’re captivated by Shakespearean drama performed under the stars or moved by a symphony echoing through the city’s ancient walls, the Dubrovnik Summer Festival is a cultural feast not to be missed.
Stradun Classic
Renowned Croatian clarinettist Marija Pavlović founded the Stradun Classic in Dubrovnik in 2018. Today, the festival is organised in collaboration with the
Dubrovnik Symphony Orchestra
, where she serves as both artist-in-residence and artistic director.
Good Food Festival
Food lovers will delight in the Good Food Festival, held every autumn. This gastronomic event celebrates the flavours of Dubrovnik and the Dalmatian region. Highlights include cooking demonstrations, wine tastings, and workshops led by renowned chefs. Visitors can savour traditional dishes, such as ‘peka’ and ‘zelena menestra’, while exploring contemporary twists on local cuisine.
The festival’s gala dinner is a standout experience, offering a multi-course meal in an unforgettable setting. With its focus on fresh, seasonal ingredients and culinary innovation, the Good Food Festival is a treat for the senses.
Lumiart 2025
The Lumiart Festival of Light transforms Dubrovnik’s streets, squares, and palaces with stunning light installations. Blending art, architecture, history, and music, it celebrates the harmony of tradition and innovation. Join us from 7th to 9th November 2025!
Dubrovnik Winter Festival
As the year draws to a close, the Dubrovnik Winter Festival brings holiday magic to the city. From late November to early January, the streets are adorned with twinkling lights and festive decorations, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The festival features Christmas market, ice skating, and concerts, making it a favourite for families and visitors seeking festive cheer. A highlight of the Winter Festival is the New Year’s Eve celebration, where people gather in the historic Old Town to welcome the New Year with live music, fireworks, and dancing.
Whether you’re donning a mask for carnival, joining the procession for St. Blaise, or immersing yourself in the arts or gastronomy, these events invite you to become part of the city’s living history. Join us and prepare to immerse yourself in Dubrovnik’s unique festivals - a celebration of tradition, community, and festivity.

Dubrovnik City Walls
Constructed over a 500-year period mainly during the 12th and 17th centuries, the Walls of Dubrovnik are amongst the most extensive and well-preserved fortifications in Europe. Stretching over 6000 feet, the uninterrupted course offers fantastic views of the coastal city. There's little shelter from the sun, so visit during the cooler months or evenings to beat the heat and for fewer crowds. You can purchase tickets from any City Wall entrance, but a Dubrovnik Pass is convenient and offers great value. A guided tour also often includes a walking tour of the Old Town as well. – Tripadvisor

Old Town
Read more
Lokrum Island
Lokrum Island, home to a botanical garden, salt lake, and Benedictine monastery dating back at least to 1023, is a great escape from the bustle of Dubrovnik. Travelers and locals alike visit this island for its idyllic walking paths, natural swimming pools, and colorful peacocks. It’s also popular among Game of Thrones fans as the filming location for Qarth. A perfect day trip, boats regularly leave from Dubrovnik's Old Town port and take just 15 minutes to get to Lokrum. An additional entrance fee is required on the island. Lokrum is busiest in the summer vacation months of July and August. – Tripadvisor
Read more
Dubrovnik Cable Car
Running year-round, the Dubrovnik Cable Car has been taking travelers up to the top of Mount Srd since 1969. In just four short minutes, you'll reach the peak and be treated to breathtaking views of Dubrovnik, the Adriatic Sea and more. At the top, check out the fortress and dine with a view at Panorama Restaurant, exceptionally stunning at sunset. For the best value, choose a tour that combines the cable car, Old Town walking tour and the Dubrovnik City Walls. Plan your visit during off-peak seasons for fewer crowds, or right when the cable car opens. – Tripadvisor

Lovrjenac Fortress
Often called "Dubrovnik's Gibraltar", this hilltop medieval fortress sits perched outside the city walls, on a promontory overhanging the Adriatic Sea. Game of Thrones fans will recognize this as the Red Keep in King's Landing. Catch your breath after the steep climb up, enjoy the breathtaking views of Dubrovnik’s Old Town and West Harbor, and wander the imposing stone corridors and patios. Take a tour to dive deep into the rich history, or a Game of Thrones-themed one for an extra dose of fantasy. Save by getting a city pass that includes entry to Fort Lovrijenac and other sites in Dubrovnik. – Tripadvisor
Read more
Lapad
Located on a peninsula, this residential neighborhood is a short bus or ferry ride away from Dubrovnik's Old Town and the surrounding islands. There are many pebble beaches for swimming and water sports along the coastline, some offering paid facilities while others can be accessed for free. Velika and Mala Petka Forest Park in the south offer lush greenery with hiking trails and coastal viewpoints. Consider staying in Lapad as a cheaper, quieter, and greener option over the busier Old Town. The buildings here are modern, and most lodging is situated around Lapad Bay and Babin Kuk. – Tripadvisor
Read more
Lopud Island
The atmosphere on Lopud Island is peaceful and relaxing, in part due to absence of cars on the island. Grab yourself a buggy taxi to the Sunj sand beach, or opt for a scenic half an hour walk. Relax in a hammock sipping on a cocktail, before checking out the restaurants, bakeries, and souvenir shops along the promenade. Lopud Island is often visited as part of a three-island tour, or as a day trip via ferry from Dubrovnik. For the best weather, time your visit between June and September. – Tripadvisor
Read more
Sveti Jakov Beach
This local favorite isn’t as well-known as Banje Beach, but offers the same splendid views. Tucked in a hidden bay to the east of Dubrovnik Old Town, Sveti Jakov (St. Jacob) Beach is surrounded by majestic cliffs and turquoise waters. The beach is covered with fine pebbles, so water shoes are recommended. A cozy beach bar and restaurant will sate any hunger pangs, and there are also sunbeds and umbrellas available for rent. After a day of snorkeling, diving, or sunbathing, climb a steep staircase to reach the historic Church of St. Jacob, after which the beach is named. – Tripadvisor

LLM RESULT (AgentType.WORKER):
I now have flight data from Momondo for Toronto to Dubrovnik flights between August 15 and September 15. The cheapest round-trip deals start around CAD $897 with flight durations ranging from roughly 12 hours (1 stop) up to long multi-stop flights lasting over 30 hours. Airlines mentioned include British Airways, Air Canada, Lufthansa, KLM, and Aer Lingus. There are no direct flights. Some flights are one stop, some two stops, with prices increasing with more stops or longer travel time. The shortest flight time Momondo shows is about 11h 45m, which can be helpful for selecting better flight times.

I will now fetch content from the Google Flights link to gather similar comparison details on flight times, prices, and carriers for this route and travel window, to refine the recommendations.

LLM RESULT (AgentType.WORKER):
The second source further confirms the prominence of the Dubrovnik Summer Festival running from mid-July to late August, which covers most of the requested date range. It also introduces the Good Food Festival held every autumn, highlighting culinary experiences with cooking demos, wine tastings, and traditional Dalmatian dishes. The Good Food Festival seems particularly relevant to late August to mid-September and beyond.

Distinctive festivals clearly offer year-round engagement, but the Summer Festival and the Good Food Festival stand out for this late summer period, combining culture and gastronomy. There’s also mention of other unique events like Lumiart Festival of Light in November and the Winter Festival later in the year, but those are outside the date range.

Next, I will fetch content from the third link, which promises the best things to do in Dubrovnik specifically during August. This should flesh out more details, especially about outdoor activities and possibly culinary and cultural experiences still ongoing specific to August and early September.

Airlines operating on this route include Air Transat, Ryanair, Porter Airlines, Lufthansa, British Airways, KLM, and others. The fastest flights offer durations around 12-17 hours including layovers. There are no direct flights available. I will now fetch the other sources, including Google Flights and Flight Centre, to confirm and gather any additional options or better deals before summarizing the best flight choices.

The Tripadvisor content lists the top-rated and best-reviewed hotels in Dubrovnik according to actual traveler reviews and ratings. It includes essential details on quality, location, amenities, and unique features for each hotel, such as Hotel Bellevue Dubrovnik, Rixos Premium Dubrovnik, Valamar Tirena Hotel, Hilton Imperial Dubrovnik, and Hotel Kompas Dubrovnik among the top ones. I have detailed, specific user-based ratings for these hotels.

My next step is to fetch and review the content from The Tour Guy, U.S. News, and the Luxury Hotel Guru sources to gather additional expert reviews, categorizations, and any luxury-specific insights. Combining these with the Conde Nast Traveller and Tripadvisor data will allow me to synthesize a well-rounded and up-to-date top 5 hotel recommendation list for Dubrovnik, Croatia.

I will proceed by fetching The Tour Guy content on the best hotels in Dubrovnik.

The second webpage outlines Dubrovnik’s unique festivals through the year, confirming that the Dubrovnik Summer Festival runs from mid-July to late August, thus overlapping with the requested timeframe. It also highlights the Good Food Festival in autumn, which includes culinary events, cooking demos, and wine tastings—likely starting just after mid-September but worth noting. Other festivals like Lumiart and Winter Festival are outside this date frame. The information reiterates that the summer festival is a rich cultural highlight with theater, concerts, and opera in historic settings, ideal for cultural travelers during late summer. I will next fetch the third URL about great things to do specifically in August to gather more precise activities and any outdoor or culinary events during this period.

It also highlights the Good Food Festival in autumn, focusing on culinary experiences including cooking demos, wine tastings, and traditional Dalmatian dishes. This complements the cultural offerings with strong culinary experiences near the requested timeframe. Next, I will review what the third source can add about August activities and experiences in Dubrovnik.

The August sun heightens
Dubrovnik'
s beauty, and its cityscape becomes a monumental stage. The Summer Festival has been its annual highlight for 67 years, and it's showing no signs of tiring: some of the world's finest orchestras and classical musicians will play amid the medieval walls this year, and literature fans will lap up the line-up of plays and poetry readings. Aside from the festival, much of the entertainment on offer consists of concerts against sublime backdrops (Park Orsula, the Church of St. Blaise). Oh, and there's also a little exhibition by Pablo Picasso. Here are ten wonderful things to do in Dubrovnik this month.

LLM RESULT (AgentType.WORKER):
<thinking>
I reviewed the Google Flights data for Toronto to Dubrovnik flights between August 15 and September 15, 2025. It confirms no direct flights are available; flights typically have 1-2 stops with durations around 10-34 hours. Prices in this period from Google Flights are higher (around CAD 962 and up) compared to some deals found on Skyscanner and Momondo which have some flights in the CAD 743-900 range. Airlines such as Air Canada, United, LOT, British Airways, and KLM are common carriers. Now I will check the last source, Flight Centre, to gather their offers and finalize a comparison to suggest the best flights considering price, duration, and airlines for the given dates.

The content fetched from the latest URL is truncated with mostly navigation and subscription information visible rather than activity details. It does mention the Dubrovnik Summer Festival as a highlight of August with orchestras, classical music, plays, and poetry readings held in stunning medieval backdrops. However, it does not yet provide concrete details on outdoor adventures or culinary experiences. To get a fuller picture, I will need to fetch content from the two remaining URLs which focus more on general must-do activities in Dubrovnik including outdoor and culinary experiences.
</thinking>
<text>
The article from Time Out emphasizes the Dubrovnik Summer Festival as a key cultural highlight in August, featuring music, plays, and literature against historic city backdrops. To complement this with insights on outdoor activities and culinary experiences during mid-August to mid-September, I will next review further sources that offer recommendations on must-do things in Dubrovnik’s summer season and highlight food festivals or outdoor adventures.

Best Family Vacations in Europe
Ever wanted a gorgeous seaside fortress of your own? Picture it: Huge stone walls keeping the lapping sea at bay, while you dine in the safety of your Baroque palace. You can come close to this fantasy with a visit to Dubrovnik, which is straight out of a dream, or if you are a "Game of Thrones" fan, right out of the wildly popular TV series. A UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979, Dubrovnik is surrounded by gorgeous medieval ramparts that have been preserved in their original form and are one of the city's main attractions.

The Flight Centre page content provided does not contain specific flight details such as times, prices, or airlines for flights from Toronto to Dubrovnik. Instead, it mainly has general site navigation and policy information. Therefore, I have no new usable data from this source to compare with prior ones. I have detailed information from Skyscanner, Momondo, and Google Flights. These show indirect flights only, with prices ranging roughly CAD $710 to over $1,000 for roundtrip economy, flight durations typically between 10 to over 30 hours, and major airlines including Air Transat, Ryanair, Porter Airlines, Lufthansa, British Airways, United, LOT, KLM, and Air France. October tends to have the cheapest flights, but options within August 15 to September 15 exist around CAD $743 to $1,000+.

I will now synthesize the best flight options based on these findings, prioritizing flights within August 15 to September 15, considering price, flight duration, and preferred airlines.
</thinking>
<text>
Based on comprehensive flight data from multiple sources, here are the best flight options from Toronto to Dubrovnik for travel between August 15 and September 15, 2025:

1. Best Value Option:
- Price: Approx. CAD $743 (round-trip)
- Airlines: Porter Airlines (outbound) + Ryanair (inbound)
- Stops: 1 stop each way
- Dates example: Depart Sept 9, Return Sept 23
- Flight Duration: Around 12-18 hours with layovers

2. Budget-Friendly Option (slightly later in season):
- Price: Approx. CAD $710 (round-trip)
- Airlines: Air Transat (outbound) + Ryanair (inbound)
- Stops: 1 stop each way
- Dates example: Depart Oct 14, Return Oct 21 (slightly outside the requested window but the cheapest)
- Flight Duration: ~12-17 hours

3. Shorter Duration Option (with slightly higher prices):
- Price: CAD $897 - $970 range
- Airlines: British Airways or Air Canada + connecting partners
- Stops: 1 to 2 stops
- Flight Duration: Around 12-17 hours
- Dates example: Late August to early September departures such as August 28 to September 2 or early September departures

Notes:
- No direct flights are available on this route.
- Popular Toronto airports: Toronto Pearson International (YYZ) and Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport (YTZ).
- Flights with Porter Airlines and Air Transat tend to offer good value.
- British Airways, Lufthansa, KLM, LOT, United, and Air France offer additional options with varying prices and durations.
- Booking earlier (about 40+ days in advance) can secure better prices.
- Flight durations typically range from 12 to over 30 hours depending on stops and layover times.

If you want, I can help you with booking or provide specific flight itineraries for your preferred dates within this period.

The Dubrovnik Winter Festival
At the Dubrovnik Winter Festival people of all ages can enjoy cultural and entertainment programs held at various locations such as Lazareti, old city centre, Lapad, and Mokošica. City is decorated with over a thousand dazzling decorations that dress it in holiday attire and spread good cheer with the festival’s favourite mascot, the Bear and the Elves, and the singing Pop-up Kolenda bus.

LLM RESULT (AgentType.WORKER):

I have gathered valuable information from multiple sources about cultural events, festivals, culinary experiences, and some outdoor activities in Dubrovnik specifically during the requested timeframe of August 15 to September 15. The key highlights include:

- The Dubrovnik Summer Festival running until the end of August with theater, opera, music, and dance in historic venues.
- Traditional Summer Music Evenings providing live music in atmospheric Old Town locations.
- The Dubrovnik Wine & Jazz Festival typically held in late September, close to the timeframe, featuring Croatian wines and jazz music.
- Good Food Festival in autumn focusing on culinary events, workshops, and tastings showcasing local Dalmatian cuisine.
- Ragusa’s Fair and Maritime Festival featuring local crafts, food, and maritime heritage.
- Outdoor activities involve exploring historic sites, enjoying concerts by ancient city walls, and possibly engaging in water or sailing activities linked to maritime festivals.
- Other local festivals and events in late summer include late summer classical music festivals that blend culture and nature.

The Agoda page was inaccessible, but other pages sufficiently cover cultural, outdoor, and culinary experiences. I now have enough details to summarize the best holiday experiences and activities for a visitor in Dubrovnik from mid-August to mid-September.
